I've created an E-Commerce application using Nest.js, a well-known Node.js framework renowned for crafting highly scalable and performant server-side applications. This project serves as the sturdy backbone for my frontend, seamlessly bridging the gap between the server and user interface.

## âœ… Features:
- Robust Authentication & Authorization with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Well-structured Modules for core entities including Product, Order, User, Address, and more
- Customized many-to-many solution, extending Product and Order relationships with additional columns (`n-to-n relationships`)
- Feature-rich Resolvers for seamless querying and mutation of shop data
- Integrated SMTP service for sending customer emails in response to specific account actions and more

This project acts as an API server, harnessing the power of TypeORM, Type-GraphQL, Nodemailer, and more. It lays the foundation for my e-store frontend application, forming the robust backend infrastructure.
